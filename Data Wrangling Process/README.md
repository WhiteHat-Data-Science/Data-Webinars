## About the webinar

1. **What is data wrangling?**
    - The process of organising, converting, mapping data from one format into another
2.  **What activities it encompasses(include)**
	- This may include activites such as data integration, enrichment, aggregation
    structuring, storage, visualisation and publishing.
3. **Why it is useful?**
	- normally the raw data is not usable, including some wrong data and missing value
	- we need to build connection beteween different data set in order to  implement anaylsis	
4. **Challenge:**
	- reformatting and validating data requires transforms that can be difficult to specify and evaluate
	- converting data values to different types

## Additional resources and further reading:

We're looking to find cool insights in our data but this is only possible if we know how to data wrangle properly using Pandas, the Python library:

- [Pandas Revision](https://dshahid380.github.io/Data-analysis-with-pandas/)
	- A series of short notebooks providing an overview of the library 
- [Pandas Lecture Series - Data School](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y)
	- Learning via videos instead of reading notebooks
- [Pandas Questions & Exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises#getting-and-knowing)
	- List of (very) short projects/questions to test your Pandas knowledge
