## Session FAQ's:
**Does dash take CSS and JavaScript as well? Or is it just HTML?**  

- Dash automatically will convert the relevant elements into CSS and JavaScript through the dash core components as necessary

  

**Can you use RGB values for the colour?**

- Yes

  

**Is there an easy way to post the dashboard on a website or to share to someone who does not have jupyter?**  

- Yes, you can deploy your code on Amazon Web Service's Elastic Beanstalk. Follow this guide: [https://www.atyson-datascience.com/post/deploying-your-dash-app-to-aws](https://www.atyson-datascience.com/post/deploying-your-dash-app-to-aws). Watch out though, as AWS is not free and can cost upwards of Â£100 a month if you leave your code running

  

If you have any questions, or want me to look over any dash code you have written, you can reach me at  [alastair.tyson@whitehat.org.uk](mailto:alastair.tyson@whitehat.org.uk)."
