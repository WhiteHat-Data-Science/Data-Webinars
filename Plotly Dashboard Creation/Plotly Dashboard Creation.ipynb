    "A good set of visualisations is essential to any data presentation, taking the audience through a journey from data collection and EDA to effectively displaying your conclusions. Someone with even the most basic knowledge of data can be brought to understand your conclusions by having them shown pictorially. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, there is still methods you can employ to improve this further- dashboarding. A dashboard is an interactive visualisation that can show much more information than a single graph. You can make full use of your dataset to produce keen insights all while wowing them with your stunning visuals. Dashboarding is a valuable skill for any data practioner who has to regularly present to stakeholders.\n",

There is a gigantic collection of options/customisations you can employ, and what you can perform is limited by your imagination. You can build simple plots which can be change between different categories to full animations of how something changes over time.\n",

    "## What is Dash?\n",
    "\n",
    "From plotly's website\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Dash platform empowers Data Science teams to focus on the data and models, while producing and sharing enterprise-ready analytic apps that sit on top of Python and R models. What would typically require a team of back-end developers, front-end developers, and IT can all be done with Dash.\" (https://plot.ly/dash/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, dash allows you to create exciting dashboards without requiring an extensive knowledge of computer science. When coding with dash you will build an app that will be run in your browser (locally though, not online). To do this, dash incorporates a significant amount of HTML. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and it is the building block of any webpage. When using, you will structure the page into different elements which tell the browser how to display the information. Typically, the browser will recognise these elements through tags. To see HTML in action, right click anywhere on this page and select inspect. If you hover over any element on the page, you should be able to see the elements in their natural form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common tags you will see are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* div - a division on the page\n",
    "* h1 - a header\n",
    "* p - a paragraph\n",
    "* ul - an unordered list\n",
    "* a - a hyperlink/URL\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be making use of just div and h1 during this exercise. One of the benefits of dash is that it will interface with the HTML for you, making it simpler to structure the app. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on html check out this guide: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for images taken from some of the apps I have built.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have now managed to display a bar chart on our app. But you can do this using matplotlib or seaborn already, so what's the fuss? Plotly has callback functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks are the true power of the plotly dashboard. They allow you to create an interactive feature which calls back to the graph, updating the display. For example, you can add a drop down box with different options which will update the bar chart when selected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add this to our app. Instead of displaying just one Pokemon, let's expand it to include all of them which a user can select.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will need an interactive way of selecting a Pokemon- we could use a text input, where a user types a name in, but this would require them knowing the correct spelling. Instead we can use a dropdown which gives all the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add this is we use dcc.Dropdown. We need to add in some options as an argument. Each option you add must be in a dictionary format {'label':a label,'value':a value} contained in a list. The label is what is displayed to the user, and the value is what the callback will make use of. They can be the same. The Pokemon dataframe has 800, so to save us adding each one individually we can use a list comprehension again"
